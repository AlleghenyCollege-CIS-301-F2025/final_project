## Reflection Questions (Final Project)

Please answer each of the following sections. Put your responses where indicated by `TODO`.

1. Explain the data for the project

- **Question:** What is the dataset you used for this project? Describe the variables, formats, and the units (if any). Where did the data come from (source, collection method, APIs, scraping, sensors, surveys, external repository, etc.)? If the data is a combination of multiple sources, explain how and why they were combined.
- **Response:** TODO

2. Explain the motivation for the project

- **Question:** What motivates this investigation? State the central research question(s) and explain why they are important (practical impact, scientific curiosity, policy relevance, pedagogical value, etc.). Who are the stakeholders and what decisions might your analysis inform?
  
- **Response:** TODO

3. Hypotheses and evidence

3.a) Required hypotheses

- **Question:** State three (3) pairs of Null and Alternative hypotheses that you will test as part of this project. For each pair, be explicit about what parameter, relationship, or effect you are testing and write both the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).
  
- **Hypothesis 1 (H0 / H1):** TODO
- **Hypothesis 2 (H0 / H1):** TODO
- **Hypothesis 3 (H0 / H1):** TODO

3.b) Evidence and argument for each hypothesis

- **Question:** For each hypothesis above, present the visualizations, statistics, and modeling work you used to support a conclusion. For visuals, include captions and briefly explain what the plot shows. For statistics, report test statistics, p-values, confidence intervals, effect sizes, and assumptions checked. For model work, briefly describe the model(s) used, training/validation approach, metrics, and why the chosen model is appropriate. 
*Note: After each introduction of a visualization, statistic, or model, explain how it supports or refutes the corresponding hypothesis.*
  
- **Hypothesis 1 — Evidence (visuals / stats / models):** TODO
- **Hypothesis 2 — Evidence (visuals / stats / models):** TODO
- **Hypothesis 3 — Evidence (visuals / stats / models):** TODO

4. General outcomes and discoveries

- **Question:** What are the overall findings from your research? Summarize the main results, surprises, limitations, and the robustness of your conclusions. What follow-up questions remain?

- **Response:** TODO

5. Methods and their effectiveness

- **Question:** Describe how your chosen methods (data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical tests, models, validation strategy, etc.) helped you gain insights. Which methods were most useful, and which did not work as expected? If you had more time or resources, what would you change or add?

- **Response:** TODO

6. Conclusions
   
- **Question:** Based on your findings, what conclusions can you draw? How do these conclusions relate back to your original research questions and hypotheses? Discuss the implications of your results for the field, stakeholders, or future research.
- **Response:** TODO


7. Ethics and responsible analysis

- **Question:** Where do ethical considerations arise in this field and in your specific project? Discuss issues such as bias in data, privacy concerns, consent, potential harms from incorrect inferences, fairness, transparency, and reproducibility. Explain why ethical thinking is necessary and how you mitigated ethical risks or would mitigate them in future work.
  
- **Response:** TODO

8. Bibliography

-- **Question:** List all sources, references, and tools you used in your project. Use a consistent citation style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) and include links where applicable. You are required to have at least two (2) scholarly references (peer-reviewed articles, books, conference papers, etc.) that informed your methodology or analysis.

- **Response:** TODO

9. Bibliography Annotations

- **Question:** For each scholarly reference in your bibliography, provide a brief annotation (2-3 sentences) summarizing its content and explaining how it contributed to your project.

- **Response:** TODO

10. Who Did What?

**Question:** Describe the contributions of each team member to the project. Be specific about who did what in terms of data collection, cleaning, analysis, visualization, writing, and any other relevant tasks.

- **Response:** TODO
